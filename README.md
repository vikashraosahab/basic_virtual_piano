🎹✨ First AI-Generated Project – Virtual Piano Web App!

Thrilled to share the very first project I built with the help of AI tools – a fully functional Virtual Piano application.
It’s interactive, minimal, and built for fun and learning!

🔧 What I used:
▪️ Cursor-based text editor for AI-assisted coding
▪️ Frontend technologies – HTML, CSS & JavaScript
▪️ Build tools to compile and optimize
▪️ Responsive design and smooth user interaction

🎵 Features:
▪️ Play notes with either your cursor or keyboard
▪️ Volume control
▪️ Octave switching
▪️ Clean UI and mapped keyboard keys (White: A-S-D-F-G-H-J | Black: W-E-T-Y-U)

This project was a great introduction to combining creativity with code using AI and web technologies. It gave me deeper insight into how AI can assist in frontend development and rapid prototyping.

🧠 Still exploring, learning, and improving — suggestions are always welcome!
